# image_segmentation_API

This was an exploration in using Python's OpenCV with Flask for my project (myHEP). This service was intended to be able to process printed and hand-drawn home exercise programs from physical therapists, and segment the document into individual exercise images.

I have not worked on this project in quite a while, and it is quite messy at the moment... This was done at Turing School of Software and Design during a 2-week project.
